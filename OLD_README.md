# 🌍 FitchGroup Codeathon '25 - Drive Sustainability using AI

Welcome to the FitchGroup Codeathon!

Your challenge is to develop machine learning models that estimate **Scope 1** and **Scope 2** greenhouse gas emissions for non-reporting companies using data from Sustainable Fitch.

This repository contains:

- 📘 README file with all the details you need to get started
- 📦 The training dataset
- 📦 The holdout test dataset
- 📁 Additional relational tables for feature engineering
- 🧪 Starter notebooks

Your goal is to engineer meaningful features, build accurate models, and submit predictions for the company-level emissions values in the **holdout test dataset**.

## ✅ Objective

Predict company-level **Scope 1** and **Scope 2** greenhouse gas emissions for a holdout set of companies using the provided datasets.

At a high-level your workflow should look something like this:
1. Fork or clone this repository
2. Train your models using the files in `data/`
3. Generate predictions using your best models for all the rows in `data/test.csv`

Then you will need to submit the following:
- A `submission.csv` file with your predictions in the format matching the example in `notebooks/submission.csv`
- Your code repository or notebook(s)
- A short explanation of your approach including:
    - the performance your models achieved on the training dataset
    - the type of model used
    - a very brief description of your feature engineering & data transformations


## 🏁 Getting Started

We have provided a couple notebooks to help you get started.

### 1. `notebooks/basic_feature_engineering.ipynb`

This notebook shows you how to:

- Load all datasets
- Merge the 1-to-many relational tables (NACE exposures, environmental adjustments, SDGs)
- Perform basic feature engineering (e.g., aggregations, weighted averages, counts)
- Prepare a modeling dataset 

Use this as your launchpad—modify it, extend it, or build your own pipeline.

### 2. `notebooks/baseline_model_and_inference.ipynb`

This example notebook demonstrates:

- How to split your data for training and validation
- How to train a simple baseline model (e.g., linear model or tree-based model)
- How to generate predictions on the test set
- How to export your submission CSV

## 📦 Dataset Details

The dataset is intentionally structured to reward thoughtful feature engineering and the data is spread across a few tables that will require some transformation to turn them into additional signals for prediction.

### 1. `data/train.csv` (Main Fact Table)
 
 One row per company. This file is used for training and validation.

## 🤖 Using AI During the Hackathon

We strongly encourage participants to use AI tools throughout the codeathon. Treat AI as an **expert advisor** that can help you think faster, explore more ideas, and improve the quality of your modeling.

Here are a couple ways to use AI effectively:

### 1. As a Machine Learning Co-Pilot

Use AI to:

- break down unfamiliar modeling concepts
- debug code
- suggest feature engineering methods
- explain cross-validation strategies
- compare algorithms and tune hyperparameters
- reason about how to handle sparse or normalized datasets

Think of AI as a **senior ML engineer** you can brainstorm with.

### 2. As a Sustainability Domain Expert

AI can also help you think deeply about the why behind emissions:

- How do sector characteristics influence Scope 1 vs. Scope 2?
- What operational activities tend to drive emissions?
- How might NACE sector mixes relate to energy intensity?
- How should environmental “benefits” or “penalties” be interpreted as signals?
- What patterns might appear in high-emissions industries?


Use AI as a **sustainability research assistant** to reason about the impact of sector exposure, energy use, business activities, and company practices.
